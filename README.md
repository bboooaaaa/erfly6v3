## Here is a project mainly writting for flysky I6 to add three features for it:

1. crossfire for ELRS TX for FSI6
2. SPI for 127X for implement ELRS TX embeded for FSI6
3. A voice Module Driven by UART 






This was forked from  https://KotelloRC/erfly6.git

Firstly ,thanks to Mr Kotello,  without his efforts  there simply would not have been this project .

Mr Kotello have done a great job and lot of work. 

Mr Kotello privided a lot help and advise while I was working on this project.


The codes of crossfire protocol is a porting version from https://github.com/OpenI6X/opentx
Thanks to Maria and Janek, they have done a great job for FSI6X.

The codes of ELRS is from https://github.com/ExpressLRS ,
Thanks to all the contributors of ElRS project also. :)



You can get help from https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3961635-ER9X-for-FS-I6-and-FS-I6X-(ERFly6)

Here is the manual for flashing firmware from Kotello : https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/ER9XFlySky%20I6En.pdf

## PROTOCOL SUPPORTED CURRENTLY:
1. PPM

## How to connect the ELRS TX  and the VoiceModule
   It is very simple to  connect ELRS TX, there is no hardware modification. Just:
   1. connect the SPORT and  GROUND WIRE to your ELRX TX, like the picture below. 
   2. Choose ELRS2 in the Menu :  MODEL SETUP -> PROTOCOL 
   

<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/tx_sport.jpg">
   
	
   It is support  ELRS v2.0 mainly, v1.1 is tested but not maintain any more.
   
## How To Enable Voice module . 

  1. firstly buy a DFPlayer  https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005003438237036.html 
   
  2. Connect it to FSI6  as the picture shown below
  <img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/voice_mp3_module.jpg">
  
  3. prepare a TF Card, plug it to the computer, then create a foled named "mp3" in the TF card
  4. copy  the voice files from https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/tree/main/VoicePackEr9x-22Khz_16bit-Sharon-Eng into the "mp3" folder
  5. unplug the TF Card from computer, plug it into the DFPlayer
  6. Power up you DFPlayer by 3.3V , and connect it to a speaker.
  7. open FSi6 transmitter, go to menu  "radio setup"->"AudioHaptic"->"Sound Mode", choose any item other than "Beeper",  for example PiSpkrVoice.
  8. Turn off the FSi6 transmitter, then turn it on, you should hear "welcome to ER9X " from your speaker
     




## If you want to make a DIY TX module that embedded into the case of FSI6, you can follow the guides below:



## Self-made 2.4G ELRS TX , built in Flysky FSI6


Difficulty: easy

###  I. Hardware:

1. LoRa radio frequency module, sx1280: E28-2G4M27S

2. MCU Wifi module: ESP-WROOM32

3. Several wires of various colors

4.1k resistor

5. Flysky FSI6 

6. One JLink, for flashing firmware

7. One 2.4G antenna

II.software:

1. EpressLRS Configurator  https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator

2. The FS i6  ERFLY6 firmware https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/Output/Release/Exe/FSI6.hex

3. JLink-FLash,  J-Link Flash Download

###  III. TX circuit diagram:

<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/tx_schm.png" >

###  IV. TX and FSI6 Transmitter wiring:
<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/tx_wiring.jpg" >
The completed TX only needs to connect 3 wires to the transmitter FSI6, a signal wire (SPORT), a 3.3V power supply, and a ground wire, as shown in the figure below



### V. Build steps:

1.  Connect E28-2G4M27S and ESP-WROOM32 with wires By "III. TX Circuit Diagram", 

2. Connect the three wires by "IV. TX and remote control wiring" ,  and fix them on the bottom plate with hot melt glue .

3. Use the USB cable to connect ESP-WROOM32 to the computer, use EpressLRS Configurator to flash the ELRS 2.0 firmware, Device selection: DIY 2400 ESP32- E28, 
		then fill in your binding password, then click Build & FLASH, watch Log, and go to flash During the firmware, you need to hold down the Boot0 button on the ESP-WROOM32 development board, or it will fail.

4. Flash the FSi6 firmware According  to  https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/ER9XFlySky%20I6En.pdf ,  The  FSI6 firmware is at https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/Output/Release/Exe/FSI6.hex

5. Complete

There are still some issues, such as heat dissipation issues, battery capacity issues, and switching tuner issues that have not been dealt with.
Try it on your own risk, Good Luck!




## Self-made 2.4 ELRS receiver, no need to board, easy to make


Difficulty: medium, mainly because the device is too small, solding requires patience

###  I. Hardware

1. LoRa RF module, sx1280: E28-2G4M12S

2. MCU Wifi module: ESP-01F

3. Several  wires of various colors

4.1k resistor

5. TTL to serial  USB adapter CH341 (CH340 or FTDI can be any one.)

6. DC-DC3.3v step-down module

7. One LED light.

### II. software:

1. EpressLRS Configurator https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS-Configurator

### III. RX circuit diagram

<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/rx_schm.png">

### IV.  Build Steps

1. First, connect the RST and BOOT (IO0) of the esp-01f to two wires. RST is used for grounding and restarting. BOOT must be grounded , When you flash the ELRS firmware, .

2. Connect the TX, RX, VCC, GND of ESP-01F to the RX, TX, 3.3V and GND of CH341, and connect to the computer. If there is no CH341 driver, install the driver. 

3. Use EpressLRS Configurator to flash the firmware, Device selection: DIY 2400 RX ESP8285 SX1280, remember to ground the boot line when flashing, and then click "Build And flash", if it is not successful, you can connect RST to ground , it will restart the ESP-01F.

<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/rx_elrs.jpeg">
 After flashing, the wires of ESP-01F and CH341 can be removed, you can update the firmware by wifi.

4. Connect E28-2G4M12S and ESP-01F with wires by "III. RX circuit diagram" , add resistors to connect the LED lights, 2G4M12S does not have TCX0EN, just don't need to connect it.

5. Connect VCC and GND to the 3.3V output of the DC-DC module. The step-down module requires ripple less than 20mv


6. The line is connected as shown in the figure:


<img src="https://github.com/aerror2/erfly6/blob/main/docimg/rx_built.jpeg">

 7. Leave out the wires of  GND, VCC, TX, RX as the connector to flight controller,   then stack the three modules with tape. The weight control is not bad, only 5g:

Build firmware - Segger Embedded Sudio
Flash firmware via J-Link (clone) or ST-Link (for FS-i6X).
To build firmware install  https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/

In File menu choose Open Solution, and Select FSI6.emProject from folder where it placed.

Choose Active Project which suitable for your radio - FSI6 or FSI6X. Build project.
If build successful flash firmware.
